{"name":"T e a m  T r a d e","tagline":"Elite: Dangerous Private Trade Data Sharing","body":"##Introduction\r\nThis is tool designed to store and share trade data from the Elite: Dangerous game.\r\n\r\nMy intention is to produce an application that's the middle ground between offline note-taking tools and the\r\ncrowd source Elite Dangerous Data Network apps that are available.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that you and a few friends will each use this tool and have each copy pointed towards a common online\r\nsource. This will allow you to individually record market supply and demand data and automatically make that information\r\navailable amongst yourselves without making your valuable trade routes public knowledge.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\nThe python script should work out of the box (although I've only tested it on Windows), provided you have the python path etc. all set up. Alternatively, you can convert the tool into a portable windows executable by following [this useful tutorial](http://logix4u.net/component/content/article/27-tutorials/44-how-to-create-windows-executable-exe-from-python-script).\r\n\r\nThe latter option is how I intended the tool to be used and the finished article will be distributed as such an executable.\r\n\r\n##Current State\r\nIf you've had a look at the contents of the repository at all, you'll see that this thing is definitely still a work-in-progress. So here's the plan:\r\n - Swap the commodity text box with a quicker way to enter supply/demand data (possibly radio buttons).\r\n - Suggest trade routes based on available data.\r\n - Read from/Save to an online source (probably a text file on Google Drive) on start/exit.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
