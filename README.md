Team Trade
==========

Introduction
------------
This is tool designed to store and share trade data from the Elite: Dangerous game.

My intention is to produce an application that's the middle ground between offline note-taking tools and the
crowdsource Elite Dangerous Data Network apps that are available.

The idea is that you and a few friends will each use this tool and have each copy pointed towards a common online
source. This will allow you each to record market supply and demand data and automatically make the information
available amongst yourselves without making your valuable trade routes public knowledge.

Current Progress
----------------
A basic UI has been built and the data storage & handling format is all set up

Next Steps
----------
 - Build quick way to enter supply/demand data.
 - Save data to easy-to-parse CSV file on exit.
 - Suggest trade routes based on available data.
 - Save to & read from online source on start/exit.
